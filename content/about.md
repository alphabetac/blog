I conceived this blog as a project to reflect on global politics, examine and condemn the tragedies and injustices that plague every government and every society, and see that there remains the possibility, the very great possibility, despite these tragedies and injustices of building a better world.

The conductor, Benjamin Zander, offers a vision of possibility that is expressed perhaps most eloquently in the well-known story of the two shoe sellers:

> *A shoe factory sends two marketing scouts to a region of Africa to study the prospects for expanding business. One sends back a telegram saying,* “Situation Hopeless. No one wears shoes.” *The other writes back triumphantly,* “Glorious Business Opportunity. They have no shoes!”

We can be in no doubt that we face tremendous challenges: the climate crisis, violence against women, slavery, children dying of easily preventable disease, and so much more that cannot fit the short length of this page. Our response cannot be one of resignation but of determination, a determination to end injustice and poverty, protect women and children from abuse and ensure workers’ rights.

As a final note, you might be wondering why I have named this blog “eudaimonia”. *Eudaimonia* is a concept from Aristotelian ethics that best translates as “human flourishing” (though others have simply called it “happiness”). Aristotle wrote:

> *for this [eudaimonia] we choose always for itself and never for the sake of something else, but honour, pleasure, reason, and every virtue we choose indeed for themselves, but we choose them also for the sake of human flourishing, judging that through them we shall be happy.*

If in our lives we are to value our contributions according to how fully we enable our own and others’ flourishing, then the path we must take in our lives is unmistakable. It embraces the challenges that face us and strives to build a better world. I hope you will join me in this exciting project, and I very much look forward to seeing the change we will bring about.

Until Next Time,

Henry
