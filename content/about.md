## Dear Reader

> *"Men who look on nature, and their fellow-men, and cry that all is dark and gloomy, are in the right; but the sombre colours are reflections from their own jaundiced eyes and hearts. The real hues are delicate, and need a clearer vision."*
>
>-- From *Oliver Twist*, by Charles Dickens

I first read these words of Charles Dickens in March 2020 whilst reading *Oliver Twist* at the height of the first Covid-19 lockdown in the UK. It was a time not necessarily of optimism but a sense of collective struggle and compassion. Perhaps it could even be crudely referred to as the 'honeymoon' of Covid-19, when we clapped for carers and cheered for the NHS; however, this was before the true impact of Covid-19 made itself known in the growing numbers of loved ones lost to the virus and before the anger towards the government for its incompetence manifested itself as strongly as it now does.

My decision to open this page with these words of Dickens is not to argue that the world or the UK is in a rosy state but it is instead to remind myself that whilst the government may continue to fail and the virus spreads, that those carers are still caring, the nurses still nursing, that there still burns in the world a furious desire to help others and spread love and joy. This gives me such wonderful hope for the time after Covid-19. It gives me hope that we will have the strength to rebuild our country into a nation that will recognise the contributions these astonishing people have made.

### By Way of Introduction

I have always loathed introductions--there always seems to be a certain awkwardness about introducing oneself, so I am going to attempt to keep things simple: my name is Henry and I am a politics student at UCL.

I must confess that this website is an entirely selfish undertaking, driven primarily by my desire to ensure that I finish writing the various drafts and scraps of essays and articles that I have hitherto unsuccessfully completed. The content will be dominated by pieces of commentary on UK politics, but it is likely that I will delve into other fields including Economics and Political Philosophy. Please do feel free to get in touch via Email (see the icon at the bottom of the page) if you have any comments on anything that I have written or would like to suggest an idea for a future article.

I hope that you--dear reader--have a fabulous day,

Henry
