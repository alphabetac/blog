I have never been terribly fond of introductions. (I appreciate not the most compelling opening to a page titled 'about' in the navigation bar and 'on introductions' in the title, but I do believe honesty is important.)

Introductions are infinitely more trouble than they are worth. It is as useful to me to know that you are a chartered accountant or a keen bird-watcher as it is to know that you are not an astrophysicist and can't stand the sound of Mendelssohn played at 3 in the morning. What would be considerably most useful than your average introduction where the introducer lists off their name, age, date of birth and profession, would be knowing whether or not they are interesting. Imagine the energy that would be saved in trying to ascertain this crucial piece of information! To my enduring disappointment, people rarely introduce themselves as "Ms. Jessica Wolverhampton, oh and by the way I am an unutterable bore". If they did, we would surely be saved the trouble of wasting unimaginable amounts of time uncovering the information by ourselves.

Putting into practice our new introduction philosophy then, I promise I'm not going to tell you what I do, who I am, or anything like that (not that you wanted to know anyway). I'm not a magician, florist, organist, undertaker, or plumber â€” as to tell you who I am. I've never wired a plug, merged or acquired, advised or instructed. But I shall leave it up to you (and don't trouble yourself to tell me) whether or not I am interesting.

Henry.
