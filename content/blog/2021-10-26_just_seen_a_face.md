> I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met

The lives of refugees across the continents, oceans and seas of the world have long formed a contentious backdrop to politics and society, and birthed many passionate feelings. For over ten years, the civil war in Syria has caused the displacement of millions. [5.6 million refugees][1] currently live in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. Of this number, over 2.5 million are children.
