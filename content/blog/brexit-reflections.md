The EU and the UK have—at last—successfully concluded negotiations. From the Brexit referendum that took place on the 23rd June 2016 to the announcement of the "EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement" on Christmas Eve, four years, six months and one day passed. It is very easy to look back upon these last four-and -a-half years, gasp at the events took place and sigh about their consequences; to see this new agreement as the *coup de grace* of the relationship between the EU and the UK.

Perhaps Ursula von der Leyen got closest to the truth by quoting T.S. Eliot: "What we call the beginning is often the end/And to make an end is to make a beginning./The end is where we start from."

Brexit does indeed mark the formal end of an extraordinary relationship that began with Britain's accession to the European Economic Community in 1973. Over the course of nearly fifty years, this organisation grew and strengthened. Of course, some would argue that it bloated and weakened but it is impossible to deny that the spirit of modern European unity was forged in the ravaging flames of destruction that continued to burn in the wake of the Second World War. A continent that had rent itself apart twice in the space of twenty-five years was now faced with the challenge of rebuilding. In separating from the European Union, we are not only separating from the largest trading block in the world; from an organisation with the most progressive climate legislation; from a community of people who can move, live and work freely. We are also separating from an ideal, an ideal that I remember learning at my old primary school—that two heads are better than one; that the value of the impact we make on this Earth is not measured by our wealth or power or personal achievements but by the impact we have on others and the positive change that we impart upon the world.
