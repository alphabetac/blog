I am dispensing with my general practice of publishing new pieces on Monday mornings to reflect upon the events of the USA Presidential Inauguration. If you were an astute follower, Dear Reader, of the events of the 20th January, then you will recognise that today's title comes from the remarkable poem written and performed by the Young Poet Laureate, [Amanda Gorman][1],

> *"Men who look on nature, and their fellow-men, and cry that all is dark and gloomy, are in the right; but the sombre colours are reflections from their own jaundiced eyes and hearts. The real hues are delicate, and need a clearer vision."*
>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---From *Oliver Twist*, by Charles Dickens

I first read these words of Charles Dickens in March 2020 whilst reading *Oliver Twist* at the height of the first Covid-19 lockdown in the UK. It was not necessarily a time of optimism but of a sense of collective struggle and compassion. Perhaps it could even be crudely referred to as the 'honeymoon period' of Covid-19, when we clapped for carers and cheered for the NHS, but this was before the true impact of Covid-19 made itself known in the growing numbers of loved ones lost to the virus and before the anger towards the government for its incompetence and mismanagement manifested itself as strongly as it now does.

My decision to open this page with these words of Dickens is not to suggest that the world or the UK is in a position of strength but it is instead to remind myself that whilst the government may continue to fail and the virus spreads, that those carers are still caring, the nurses still nursing, that there still burns in the world a furious desire to help others and spread love and joy. This gives me such wonderful hope for the time after Covid-19. It gives me hope that we will have the strength to rebuild our country into a nation that will recognise the contributions these astonishing people have made.

> *“In the human breast, in every century and every country, there have been two flames burning: the flame of anger against injustice and the flame of hope that you can build a better world.”*
