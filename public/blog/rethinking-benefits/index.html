<p>The Covid-19 crisis has thrown into sharp relief the effects of sustained cuts to essential services, particularly within health and social care. 10 years of austerity has placed services, such as the NHS, in an exceptionally difficult position, now that they are faced with battling a serious health crisis. Alongside the profound health impacts that Covid-19 has brought to the UK, the economic impact has been record-breaking. The shock brought about by the drop in consumer confidence and the government lock down caused GDP to fall by 24.5% from February to May 2020. According to a report by McKinsey, around 7.6 million jobs (equivalent to 24% of the UK workforce) are at risk as a result of Covid-19 lockdowns, with those on lower incomes the most at risk. Their mid-point scenario would see the rate of unemployment more than double from 4% in February 2020 to 9% by the end of 2020.</p>
<p>This presents a stark picture of the likely future of work in the United Kingdom. The implications of these economic threats are very real—higher rates of child poverty, higher rates of suicide, a greater usage of food banks. The last financial crisis heralded a decade of stagnation and austerity that hollowed out many of the nation&rsquo;s public services, reduced real wages by 3% and increased child poverty by 38%. To prevent similar impacts of this latest (and significantly bigger) economic crisis, immediate, decisive and radical action is required to mitigate the worst effects of such monumental challenges.</p>
<p>In the face of these threats, ensuring the safety net is sufficiently robust to protect people from the instability and uncertainty of the economy post-Covid must be one of the cornerstones of any responsible economic policy. A bolstered safety net, in combination with a robust programme of job creation (such as that championed by supporters of the green new deal) would give certainty to workers and boost the economy. However, for many years reforms to the welfare system have focused on demonising welfare and its claimants. Headlines chastising &lsquo;scroungers&rsquo; for living off the backs of others have only encouraged governments to adopt policies that treat welfare claimants even more harshly.</p>
<p>It takes only a cursory glance over the fallout from Universal Credit to see in what poor regard welfare and its recipients are held by government. Five-week waits for benefits that have forced people to use food banks serve to highlight the dire need for not only reform of the system, but reform of the very concept of welfare. It is imperative to show both policy makers and voters that welfare is not the result of greed but of necessity—it is an essential mechanism by which governments provide stability to those most in need. Polly Toynbee rightly asked how governments expect those on Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance to up-skill when they are &ldquo;forced by sanctions to waste their lives applying for non-existent jobs instead of getting a serious qualification?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whilst Covid-19 has brought appalling health and economic consequences, it has also provided a rare opportunity to break new political and economic ground. Recent research published by Daniel Edmiston et al. on the LSE British Politics and Public Policy Blog has provided evidence to show that despite the recent suspension of conditionality by the Government, over 80% of new Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance claimants are already looking for jobs. It is, therefore, imperative to reshape the false narrative around benefits to instead recognise that benefits claimants do not lack the motivation to work but instead urgently need the support of government in order to put them in the best possible place to enter or re-enter the workforce. We must, in short, stop attempting to shrink the safety net in fear and ignorance but instead widen its scope and fix the places where people fall through.</p>
